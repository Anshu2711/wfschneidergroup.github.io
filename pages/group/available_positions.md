# Available Positions
We are always interested in attracting new undergraduate and graduate students from the Departments of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and Chemistry and Biochemistry to participate in our on-going research programs. We have a diverse and highly interactive [research group](/pages/group/current_lab_members) and a variety of [research projects](/pages/research/overview.md) to contribute to.

In addition, post-doctoral positions are occasionally available within the group. Interested candidates should send a CV and coverletter to [Bill Schneider](mailto:wschneider@nd.edu) clearly describing your previous research experience and especially how your research interests and abilities align with and could contribute to the on-going activities in our research group.
